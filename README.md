# EChemDID-SEI
To use LAMMPS with EChemDID you must download (lammps-31Aug2021.tar.gz from https://download.lammps.org/tars/) then you just copy  EChemDID-31Aug2021/ (that is in ECHEMDID.tar.gz) into LAMMPS/src/ECHEMDID and from src type: make yes-kspace yes-manybody yes-molecule yes-rigid yes-reaxff yes-qeq yes-echemdid // In this order.
#
Inside ECHEMDID.tar.gz inside the folder examples/EChemDID/ and in EChemDID-SEI/ you would find a good example of the use of EChemDID.
